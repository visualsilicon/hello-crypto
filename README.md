# Hello Crypto

This demo tutorial shows how to integrate cryptocurrency features into your apps/games. A crypto integration “hello-world”.

Developers have many choices of blockchains and cryptocurrencies when deciding to add in-game transactions and digital asset (Web3) features to their games. For this tutorial, we have used the Solana blockchain to demonstrate the concepts.

This project was initially launched by visualSilicon in April 2024 for the Toke2049 event in Dubai/UAE.

You can find the steps in "[Getting Started with Solana in Unity](./tutorials/getting-started-with-solana-in-unity/README.MD)" which shows how to integrate Solana into your Unity games.
